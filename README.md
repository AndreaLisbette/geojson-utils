GeoJSON Utils
=========

This repository contains scripts and utilities for converting GeoJSON to other non-standardized json formats and vice versa. 

Currently only GeoJSON to Esri JSON has been developed, but a more generic conversion tool is being developed. 

## Examples

### [Leaflet](http://esri.github.com/geojson-utils/examples/esri_leaflet.html)
This example shows how to map simple json features from Esri within the Leaflet Javascript mapping library.

### [Simple Features](http://esri.github.com/geojson-utils/examples/test.html)
This example shows how to map simple geojson features on an Esri JS API based map.

### [Search GeoCommons](http://esri.github.com/geojson-utils/examples/esri_geocommons.html)
